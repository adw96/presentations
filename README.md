# presentations

Update (Aug 2022): I am now posting presentations [here](https://github.com/statdivlab/presentations) instead.

This repository contains an inexhaustive compilation of slides from presentations I've given. I give presentations to  microbial ecologists, statisticians, mathematicians, microbiologists, clinical medicine practitioners, and epidemiologists, amongst other groups.

Disclaimer: Slides may be meaningless without context and commentary. Jokes are not clearly labelled, and motivation/background are normally spoken rather than written. I also occasionally use humour, which may be misinterpreted as sarcasm. Please request clarification if you need it.

If you use these slides, please let me know and acknowledge relevant papers. For a full list of publications check out [my lab website](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/publications).
